<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
The BSU codelab project aims to deliver custom, <em>temporary</em> programming
environments for students, research staff, and faculty.  The environments are
defined by docker containers derived (typically) from one of the jupyter
notebooks docker images found
<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks">here</a> or similar
containers.  These provide programming environments for Python 2, Python 3, R,
Julia, and possibly other environments.  For more information, contact BSU
research computing.
